          <strong>ChefGPT:</strong><br>
          <span>ChefGPT is a kitchen assistant to help creatively generate whatever recipe fits your needs! Need something vegan, healthy, and cheap to cater for a dessert party? Just ask! ChefGPT can accommodate nearly all dietary restrictions and situations.</span><br><br>
          <strong>Cookbook:</strong><br>
          <span>ChefGPT now comes with an added cookbook! Any time you make a recipe, weâ€™ll save it to your cookbook, and allow you to name it, add it to your favorites, or delete it all together.</span><br><br>
          <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br>
          <span>chefGPT uses openAI's chatgpt language processing AI in order to create potential cooking solutions.

          <strong>Bugfixes:</strong><br>
          <span>You may notice that there is a distinction between firstapp and firstappWorking. </span>
          <span>This I believe to be an error in one or more of us pushing node_modules or other packages specific  </span>
          <span>to our machine. In this case, because the project is mostly individual, I decided to </span>
          <span>sort of partition the projects into groups based on which node_modules package worked for the group members.</span>
